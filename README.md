Few notes from OSCP progress

Read "The Linux Command Line" -> Started PWK Course ->Started "Nmap Network Scanning" book -> CompTIA Pentest+ -> eLearnSecurity eJPT -> completed most of PWK (including buffer overflow section) -> Started eLearnSecurity eCPPT Study -> Re-upped lab time and started breaking into boxes

I would recommend eLearnSecurity so far. If you've tried their free "barebones" demos they don't do the certs justice. The most useful part of the course is running the labs and replicating them on the exams. It is not hard but there is enough to learn to make it worth it for personal satisfaction.

KeepNote is fantastic. I don't want to give away anything about the cert, because if anyone does read this it will take away from the joy of enumerating, learning tools, and breaking in. That said, for keepnote I am following the following page hierarchy: PWKv1 Folder -> Domain -> Ip address with nmap scan (hostnmae in parenthesis) -> a page for each service as needed, a page for attempt (regardless of success) thought process -> a sub-page for tool output under each service

I also use color to indicate stage. Red means unexploited, green is full privileges, dark green for limited privilege, and yellow for the 3-4 known difficult machines to attempt last. It took a few tries to figure out what works best but keepnote is amazing.

So far the plan is to attempt to break into as many boxes, make sure I understand windows priv esc specifically (ideally also reading a windows internals book). If I am unable to pass before the webcam implementation I may not take it since it seems intrusive unfortunately.
